## <center> Profile </center>

I am Rui Xu, Ph.D. in Engineering, graduated from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanjing University of Science and Technology(南京理工大学), PCALab, under the supervision of Professor Jin Xie (国家级青年人才). Currently employed as a Lecturer at the College of Computer and Electronic Information/Department of Artificial Intelligence at Nanjing Normal University(南京师范大学), and a member of Professor Qian’s research team (Headed by Professor Jianjun Qian, 国家级青年人才). My main research areas include 3D point cloud processing, 3D model retrieval and generation, and contrastive learning. I have published 5 papers in prestigious conferences such as AAAI, ACMMM, ECCV, and CVPR, with 3 as the first author. I am involved in a National Natural Science Foundation project and serve as a reviewer for multiple international authoritative conferences.

### Our research team is continuously seeking motivated graduate students to join our group. Interested candidates are warmly welcome to contact me at xurui@nnu.edu.cn.
